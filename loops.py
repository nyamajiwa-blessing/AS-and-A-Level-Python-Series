# As one of the most basic functions in programming, loops are an important piece to nearly every programming
# language. Loops enable developers to set certain portions of their code to repeat through a number of loops which
# are referred to as iterations. This episode covers using multiple types of loops and applications of loops in Python.

# counter = 1
found = False

# while counter <= 10:
#     print(counter)
#     counter = counter + 1

numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# for num in numbers:
#     print(num)

# print("Counting to 10 using the range() function")

# for x in range(1,11):
#     print(x)

# for y in range(1,16):
#     if (y % 2) == 0:
#         continue
#     print(y)
# search = 45
# for i in numbers:
#     if(i == search):
#         found = True
#         break

# if found:
#     print("Found element ", search)
# else:
#     print("Unable to locate specified item.")
